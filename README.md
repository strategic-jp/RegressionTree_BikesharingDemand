# RegressionTree_BikesharingDemand
When using linear regression models and regression trees, we observe changes in predictive performance. For regression trees, predictive models are designed using Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
A linear regression model and a regression tree are compared using the training data set used in kaggle's bikesharing demand competition.

A model with good predictive power varies depending on the nature of the data. For this analysis, for the regression tree, a predictive model is designed using Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
